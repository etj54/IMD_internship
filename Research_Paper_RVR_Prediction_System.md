## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Runway Visual Range (RVR) is a critical meteorological parameter in aviation that measures the distance over which a pilot can see the runway surface markings or lights that delineate the runway or identify its centerline. RVR is essential for determining whether aircraft can safely take off or land under specific weather conditions, particularly during periods of reduced visibility due to fog, precipitation, or other atmospheric phenomena.

Traditional RVR measurement systems rely on transmissometers or forward scatter visibility sensors positioned along runways. While these provide real-time measurements, they do not offer predictive capabilities, leaving pilots and air traffic controllers to make decisions based on current conditions without insight into future visibility trends.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Delhi Airport, being one of the busiest airports in India and the world, experiences significant weather-related visibility challenges, particularly during winter months when fog conditions can severely impact flight operations. The lack of predictive RVR capabilities results in:

- Reactive rather than proactive operational decisions
- Increased flight delays and cancellations
- Suboptimal resource allocation
- Potential safety risks during rapid visibility changes

### 1.3 Research Objectives

This research aims to develop and implement a machine learning-based real-time RVR prediction system that:

1. Provides accurate RVR predictions for multiple runway zones
2. Integrates real-time meteorological data with historical patterns
3. Offers an intuitive web-based visualization interface
4. Supports both historical analysis and real-time operational use
5. Demonstrates scalability for application to other airports

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Existing RVR Prediction Methods

Traditional approaches to visibility prediction have primarily relied on numerical weather prediction models and statistical methods. Gultepe et al. (2007) developed fog forecasting systems using meteorological parameters, while Bergot et al. (2005) focused on one-dimensional fog models for aviation applications.

### 2.2 Machine Learning in Aviation Weather Prediction

Recent advances in machine learning have shown promising results in weather prediction applications. Random Forest and Support Vector Machine approaches have been applied to visibility forecasting (Marzban et al., 2007), while neural networks have shown success in short-term weather prediction (Gardner & Dorling, 1998).

### 2.3 XGBoost in Time Series Prediction

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) has emerged as a powerful algorithm for time series prediction tasks, particularly in scenarios with complex non-linear relationships between features. Chen & Guestrin (2016) demonstrated its effectiveness in various prediction tasks, making it suitable for meteorological applications.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 System Architecture

The RVR prediction system consists of four main components:

1. **Data Collection Module**: Automated ingestion of RVR logs and weather data
2. **Machine Learning Pipeline**: XGBoost model training and prediction
3. **Real-time Prediction Engine**: Live data processing and prediction generation
4. **Visualization Interface**: Interactive web-based map with temporal controls

### 3.2 Data Sources and Preprocessing

#### 3.2.1 RVR Log Data

The system utilizes historical RVR data from 2020-2024, covering multiple runway configurations at Delhi Airport:

- **Runways**: 09, 10, 11, 27, 28, 29
- **Zones**: Beginning (BEG), Middle (MID), Touchdown Zone (TDZ)
- **Temporal Resolution**: 10-minute intervals
- **Data Volume**: 217,330 total records across all years (2020-2024)

#### 3.2.2 Weather Data

Meteorological data includes:
- Temperature and humidity measurements
- Wind speed and direction
- Atmospheric pressure
- Precipitation data

        self.target_runways = target_runways or [
            "RWY 09 (BEG)", "RWY 09 (TDZ)", "RWY 09 (MID)",
            "RWY 10 (BEG)", "RWY 10 (TDZ)", "RWY 10 (MID)",
            # ... additional runway configurations
        ]
```

#### 3.3.2 XGBoost Model Configuration and Hyperparameter Optimization

The system employs advanced hyperparameter optimization using RandomizedSearchCV to achieve optimal model performance:

```python
# Hyperparameter search space
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200, 300],
    'max_depth': [4, 6, 8, 10],
    'learning_rate': [0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2],
    'subsample': [0.8, 0.9, 1.0],
    'colsample_bytree': [0.8, 0.9, 1.0],
    'min_child_weight': [1, 3, 5],
    'gamma': [0, 0.1, 0.2]
}

# RandomizedSearchCV optimization
random_search = RandomizedSearchCV(
    estimator=XGBRegressor(),
    param_distributions=param_grid,
    n_iter=50,  # 50 combinations per model
    scoring='r2',
    cv=3,
    random_state=42

#### 3.3.3 Model Training and Validation

The dataset was split using temporal stratification:
- **Training Set**: 2020-2022 (80%)
- **Test Set**: 2023-2024 (20%)

This approach ensures the model's ability to generalize to future time periods, using 217,330 total RVR records spanning from January 2020 to February 2024.

    def __init__(self, model_dir="saved_models"):
        self.model_dir = Path(model_dir)
        self.models = {}
        self.scalers = {}
        self.feature_columns = {}
        self._load_models()
```

The real-time system:

    # Create base map centered on Delhi Airport
    airport_coords = [28.5562, 77.1000]
    m = folium.Map(location=airport_coords, zoom_start=15)
    
    # Add runway markers with RVR status colors
    # Green: RVR > 1200m, Yellow: 550-1200m, Red: < 550m
